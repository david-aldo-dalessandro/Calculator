## Overview

This **Calculator** app provides a simple yet powerful way to practice building a project step by step. Each new feature of the app is a mini-assignment that encourages you to learn and apply **HTML** and **CSS** concepts in a structured way.

In addition to learning web development, you will also get hands-on experience with **GitHub** for version control and **Jira** for managing tasks and user stories.

## Features

- **Responsive Calculator**: A simple, functional calculator built with HTML and CSS.
- **Mini Assignments**: Each feature or enhancement is provided as a small task, guiding you to add functionality or style to the calculator.
- **Version Control**: Use **Git** and **GitHub** to track your changes and commit your progress.
- **Task Tracking**: Use **Jira** to track each feature as a user story, helping you organize your tasks and ensure you’re meeting deadlines.

## Learning Goals

By working through this project, you will:

- Learn how to build a functional **calculator** using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Understand how to work with version control using **Git** and **GitHub**.
- Learn to track your project progress by writing and managing **user stories** in **Jira**.
- Gain experience working with a **structured development workflow**: coding, testing, and iterating while managing tasks and feedback.

## How It Works

The **Calculator** app is built using **HTML** and **CSS**. The aithmetic functionality of the app is not included as this is a visual application only. However, the app is designed to be extended by completing small assignments that teach coding concepts.

### Example Assignments:
1. **Styling the Calculator**: Style the calculator with CSS to make it visually appealing.
2. **Adding Functionality**: Enhance the calculator by adding the JavaScript functionality for operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the calculator is responsive and works on different screen sizes.
4. **Advanced Styling**: Apply more advanced CSS techniques like animations or transitions.

### Using GitHub for Version Control

As you work on each mini-assignment, you will:

- Create branches for each task or feature.
- Commit your code frequently to GitHub.
- Create **pull requests** to merge your changes into the main branch, ensuring that your work is reviewed and that your progress is well-documented.

### Using Jira for Task Management

Each task or feature is managed as a **Jira user story**. Here's how you can integrate Jira into your workflow:

1. **Create a Jira Project**: Set up a project in Jira for this app.
2. **Create User Stories**: For each mini-assignment, create a user story in Jira. The user story should describe the task you need to complete (e.g., "As a user, I want a working addition function on the calculator").
3. **Track Progress**: Move the user stories through different stages (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Completed") as you complete each task.

This workflow helps you break down complex tasks into manageable pieces, just like a real-world software development process.

## Requirements

Before you start working on the app, make sure you have the following:

- **A web browser**: To run and test the app.
- **Text editor/IDE**: Such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom, to write your HTML and CSS code.
- **Git**: Version control software to manage your code changes. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **GitHub**: To track your code and collaborate with others. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- **Jira**: Task management tool to track progress and manage user stories. [Create a Jira account](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

## Contributing

This project is open for contributions! If you'd like to help improve the app or add additional features, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
4. **Commit your changes** and push them to your fork.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a description of your changes.

We welcome contributions related to:

- Enhancing the **styling** of the calculator.
- Adding **new features** to the calculator (e.g., square roots, memory functions).
- Improving **documentation** or **tutorials** for new learners.
- Fixing **bugs** or improving the code structure.

## Tracking Progress with Jira

Here’s how you can track your progress with Jira:

1. **Set up a Jira Project**: Create a new project in Jira and set it to "Kanban" or "Scrum" (your choice).
2. **Create a Backlog**: Add tasks for each mini-assignment as **user stories** (e.g., "As a user, I want the calculator to perform addition").
3. **Organize Your Work**: Break the project down into smaller tasks and assign due dates to keep yourself on track.
4. **Move Tasks**: Use Jira’s boards to move your tasks from "To Do" to "In Progress" and finally to "Done" as you complete them.

By following these steps, you’ll have a clear, organized workflow for building your calculator app while practicing coding, GitHub usage, and project management with Jira.
